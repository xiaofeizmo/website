The blood line keeps merging, flowing, sinking. Breath propelled into motion out of space. All the deaths before us, what flight are you taking?<br><br>TRST invites you to join our first reading session, Body So Low. The text chosen is Traditions of Divine Transcendents, a collection of biographies, or eulogies, attributed to Ge Hong from the 3rd-4th century China, about ordinary human beings on the quest for radical departure. In other words, "They shed their mortal forms and melted away."<br><br>As an obscure and unfamiliar text, Traditions of Divine Transcendents was compiled in the beginning of the formation of Taoism. These practitioners demonstrated the use of matter and process as supposed means of achieving what cannot be simply understood as the obviation of death, but rather to attain an exalted state of existence through assimilating to and connecting with distant realms.The attainment assumed a process of inner studies and enhanced awareness of reality.<br><br>We hope this somehow opaque text could bring thoughts towards imagining questions such as how to act radically; overcoming fear; afterlife of institutions; matter and spirit in consumerism; friendship and kinship in different spaces and temporalities; and together we collect inspirations from the text and celebrate. We are not searching for any solutions in this journey of reading.<br><br>The Room of Spirit and Time is initiated by Taro Masushio, Xiaofei Mo, Ali Van, Wang Xu and Cici Wu.

She trains and works with an AI named POND (2016-present) to explore the porous nature of image and language, memory and feeling, friction and movement. POND have no mother tongue, they learn from and in translation, and grow organs without body. Her works were shown at Hordaland Kunstsenter, Bergen (2023), International Kurzfilmtage Winterthur (2021), Empty Gallery at Art Basel Hong Kong (2020), and c4 projects, Copenhagen (2019).
